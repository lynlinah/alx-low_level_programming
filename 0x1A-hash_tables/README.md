Python Dictionaries
Python dictionaries are implemented using hash tables. When you will be done with this project, you will be able to better understand the power and simplicity of Python dictionaries. So much is actually happening when you type d = {'a': 1, 'b': 2}, but everything looks so simple for the user. Python doesnâ€™t use the exact same implementation than the one you will work on today though.
